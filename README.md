### Fraudulent Claims Detection Model

❖ Business Requirement
As part of my university dissertation, I developed a proof of concept (POC) for the company by creating a robust 
Fraudulent Claims Detection Model using open source data to identify and mitigate deceptive activities within insurance 
claims processes.
❖ Objective
Enhance fraud detection capabilities through the integration of historical claims data and relevant data points, 
employing advanced feature engineering techniques.
❖ Solution
Developed a frontend UI with HTML and Flask for input processing, leveraging MLflow for model deployment and finetuning in VS Code with GitHub version control. Integrated MLflow for optimizing model accuracy and conducted 
experiments to enhance fraud detection effectiveness.
